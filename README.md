# PFFPL

**PFFPL** stands for [Practical Foundations for Programming Languages](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Foundations-Programming-Languages-Professor/dp/1107029570/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2OHAQQ1YEWBEF&keywords=foundations+for+programming+languages+harper&qid=1577950262&s=books&sprefix=foundations+for+program%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C-1&sr=1-2]Programming), the book written by Robert Harper. 

The book is all about designing a programming language. I believe, if you are even a beginner with some knowledge in HTML/CSS, it is a great challenge to tackle with all these tricky math formulas and enigmatic combination of words.  

And now, simplified dictionary for the book by Robert Harper is needed in plain language.
